# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available on coursera's website.

## Steps to follow for this course project

- Download the data source and put into a folder on your local drive. You'll have a UCI HAR Dataset folder.

- Put run_analysis.R in the parent folder of UCI HAR Dataset, then set it as your working directory using setwd() function in RStudio.
run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.
Run source("run_analysis.R"), then it will generate a new file averages_data.txt in your working directory, uploaded in the course project's form.

- CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
